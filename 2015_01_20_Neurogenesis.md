## Lecture

Neuron regeneration considered heretical even 10 years ago.

Overturned in 1965 by Altman and Das

BrdU evidence was controversial due to claims that it's impossible to distinguish signals from DNA synthesis vs repair

Carbon14 vs tissue level. Look at decay of levels in tissue vs atmospheric decay. Spalding, Cell 2013.  Shows that nearly entire dentate gyrus turns over in lifetime of humans.

What is the neural stem cell?  Took 20 years to identify neural stem cells. Applied AraC to block mitosis for seven days.  Then observe which cells show up in order: stem cell -> progenitors.  As further evidence, ablate/block neural stem cell and observe arrested neurogenesis. Also, perform lineage tracing to observe both renewal and differentiation into all subsequent cell types.

Lesson: Greater resolution of tools leads to overturn of understanding.

Young adult-born neurons are more plastic than others. Thus, despite being minority of cells, they actually account for significant effect function.

Role of hippocampus:
* Pattern completion: Retrieve memories relevant to context.
* Pattern separation: Distinguish similar memories.

Hippocampal neurogenesis necessary for context discrimination.

Hippocampus also impacts mood. Directly connected to parts of brain that further respond to interpreted signals.

Exercise is beneficial to increase neurogenesis/functionalizing.

Social isolation is severely detrimental.

Many potential opportunities to reengineer brain, including making regions more plastic.  Exercise turns out to turn on many of these things.

### Now

Stuber 2014, combining optogenetics, small optical imaging setups, and all chemical/genetic/viral tools

Leading to small molecule to induce neurogenesis

**Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve pattern separation.Sahay A, Scobie KN, Hill AS, O'Carroll CM, Kheirbek MA, Burghardt NS, Fenton AA, Dranovsky A, Hen R.Nature. 2011 Apr 28;472(7344):466-70. doi: 10.1038/nature09817. Epub 2011 Apr 3.**

BAX gene known to cause cell death in adult neurons.  Deleted BAX.  Resulted in neurons living longer.  Resulted in better performance in context-discrimination task.  Showed no difference in other tasks.

Shows the importance of using various behavior tasks.

Implications include support for utility of developing therapies for ageing-related neurogenesis deficits.

### Questions

I wonder if Amar kept trying to do more complex tasks until he hit some difference.  That will be interesting to ask.

Experiment was done on 14-18 week old mice.  Was it tried on younger or older mice?  What might be the effect?

## Lab

### Open Field Anxiety Assay

Conflict.

Optogenetic activation.
Dorsal stimulation - more exploration.
Ventral simulation - Anxiolytic effect. less exploration. More time spent in center.

Clarify / idisco

### Contextual Fear Conditioning

CS-US pairing

US: Unconditional stimulus

CS: Conditional stimulus

Shock box. Mouse freezes in subsequent exposure, even without stimulus.

1. learning (hippocampus)
2. fear (amygdala)

Shock box + control box.

Context discrimination

### Mouse-ception

engram - physical neurons associated with a memory.

### Relationship to humans

Thomas Inso(sp?)

Brain initiative - move toward more circuit-based analysis

want better than prozac, fluoxetine

### Tools

optogenetics
clarity
single photon endoscopy

### Endophenotypes

Behavior symptoms described as component phenotypes linked to genotypes
