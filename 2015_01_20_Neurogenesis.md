**Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve pattern separation.Sahay A, Scobie KN, Hill AS, O'Carroll CM, Kheirbek MA, Burghardt NS, Fenton AA, Dranovsky A, Hen R.Nature. 2011 Apr 28;472(7344):466-70. doi: 10.1038/nature09817. Epub 2011 Apr 3.**

BAX gene known to cause cell death in adult neurons.  Deleted BAX.  Resulted in neurons living longer.  Resulted in better performance in context-discrimination task.  Showed no difference in other tasks.

Shows the importance of using various behavior tasks.

### Questions

I wonder if Amar kept trying to do more complex tasks until he hit some difference.  That will be interesting to ask.

Experiment was done on 14-18 week old mice.  Was it tried on younger or older mice?  What might be the effect?
