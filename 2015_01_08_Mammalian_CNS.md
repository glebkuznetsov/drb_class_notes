# DRB Bootcamp: Mammalian CNS

Jeffrey Macklis

## Pre-meditations

The study of the mammalian nervous system development comes with many unfamiliar terms. I skimmed through the assigned readings but struggled to really get a good grasp of what was going on.

## Readings

### Background

**Arlotta, P., Molyneaux, B.J., Chen, J., Inoue, J., Kominami, R., and Macklis, J.D. (2005). Neuronal subtype-specific genes that control corticospinal motor neuron development in vivo. Neuron 45, 207– 221.**

This paper explores the signatures that distinguish corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) from two other populations of cortical projection neurons: callosal projection neurons and corticotectal projection neurons.

**Greig LC, Woodworth MB, Galazo MJ, Padmanabhan H, Macklis JD. Molecular logic of neocortical projection neuron specification, development and diversity. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013; 14(11): 755-69.**

This paper reviews what is known about the molecular underpinnings of neocortical projection neuron development.

### Franco vs Guo

**Santos J. Franco, Cristina Gil-Sanz, Isabel Martinez-Garay, Ana Espinosa, Sarah R. Harkins-Perry, Cynthia Ramos, Ulrich Müller. Fate-Restricted Neural Progenitors in the Mammalian Cerebral Cortex. Science. 2012 337, 746-749.**

**To be contrasted with contradictory paper: Chao Guo, Matthew J. Eckler, William L. McKenna, Gabriel L. McKinsey, John L.R. Rubenstein, and Bin Chen. Fezf2 Expression Identifies a Multipotent Progenitor for Neocortical Projection Neurons, Astrocytes, and Oligodendrocytes. Neuron, 80, 1167–1174**

This paper, and the following, explore whether radial glial cells (RGCs) are pre-determined to become either upper or lower cortex.  This paper concludes that some RGCs are pre-determined. The following paper says there is not such pre-determination and any cell can become any other.

Franco et al. find that RGCs express Cox2 meaning they are destined for upper cortex. This challenges dogma in the field.

Six layers - layer VI is deepest

Proportions of layers changes with area, depends on function

Named by where cell body sits, and where they send their projection

projection neurons vs interneurons

### Projection neurons

A. commissural

    - collosal projection neurons: send axon to mirror image target in other hemisphere

B. associative

    - ipsilateral associative: Connect different parts of brain

Exception: Some neurons have axons to multiple areas in brain, responding differently to to signals on the axons.

C. corticofugal

neurons that send signals away from cortex to e.g. thalamic regions

### Other

Increasing projection neurons with increased evolutionary complexity

### Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN)

Send projections from motor cortex to brain stem

one of two types of neurons that degenerate in ALS

Mice don't need them for basic movement / mating. Mice use them for fine motor manipulation.

How do neurons decide their axon connectivity?

### Motivation for studying CSMN

Protoypical for all projection neuron circuitry: organization, function, evolution

* understand/prevent degeneration
* support diseased neurons
* enhance regeneration
* identify disease genes
* m / h iPS / ES models
* replace diseased neurons

### Function

Sublinical dysfunction may lead to vulnerability / disease later on - Bostonn bridge

Evolutionarily advanced design that may lead to disaster. E.g. ALS individuals are often athletes.

Sharp areal boundaries

### Methods

identify hodology - where neuron sends axon

retrograde labeling

viral injections (AAV) for anterograde labels

example: single gene overexpression redirects target of neuron axon

### Connection to Franco and Guo papers

Is there a single chassis / a single progenitor that leads to all neurons?

Franco argues different progenitors, same as Macklis lab view.

Guo paper argues that all progenitors are the same.

Different progenitors model results in boolean molecular logic that determines fate.

subtypes of progenitors determined by set of proteins (~400) expressed in growth cone
