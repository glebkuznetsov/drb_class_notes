# DRB Bootcamp: Drosophila, Apoptosis

## Lecture

### Apoptosis Roles in Development

* sculpting
* deleting structure
* adjusting cell numbers
* eliminating injured cells

### Proteins

Ced 3 prteins in C. elegans homologous to caspases (cyteseine proteases) in mammals

Smac: pro-apoptosis protein; clinical trials for cancer drug

Grim, Reaper, Hid, and Sickle, which are collectively known as RHG
- act by binding to and neutralizing IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)

### Why more cells than you need in development?

Adds flexibility / robustness. If some cells don't arise then have fallback?

Deletion of intergenic region affects expression of RHG

### Other

How chromatin conformation / 3D structure related to cell death?

No lab defects in C. elegans that have apoptosis blocked. However, Drosophila die (fall in food).

### Misc Questions

Can we design a minimal development program?

Can we replace development program components with others, more simplified?  Would this be useful?  What problems would this solve?

Look into apoptosis / cancer papers.
