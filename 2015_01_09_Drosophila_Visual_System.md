# DRB Bootcamp: Drosophila Visual System

Matt Pecot
1/9/15

## Lecture

Langley 1895 - molecular mechanisms imply specificity; as opposed to timing/spatial proximity

### Layers

vertebrates - layers determined by location of cell body

drosophila - layers determined by targets of arbors; surrogate to synaptic specificity

synapses self-organize in drosophila. Pecot lab interested in understanding molecular mechanisms guiding this self-organization.

### Tools

cell-type specific developmental drivers

visualize endogenous proteins in single identified neurons

circuit assembly in living animals

dense synaptic maps

FISSEQ?

Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) - Lee and Luo 1999

    - genetically mark single neuron and follow development

### Current work

Isolate specific cell types (L1 - L5, R7, R8)

Use FACS

RNA sequencing: RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) - reveals which genes to further investigate

Found families of cell-surface genes that are specific to layers

DFezf - drosophila ortholog of mammalian gene Fezf

### Take-aways

Individual neurons choose synaptic partners among immense complexity - how can we simulate/model this?  Thinking about recapitulating development rather than final organism state.

### Questions

What about role of glia?

## Readings

### Pecot et al 2013

**Pecot, M.Y., et al., Multiple interactions control synaptic layer specificity in the Drosophila visual system. Neuron, 2013**

How do R8 neurons target specific region in the medula?

#### RNAi Screen

GAL4 driven by L1-L15

UAS activator in front of RNAi

Results in 4 hits:

1. Alk
2. CadN
3. Sema-1a
4. Tace (Tumor necrosis alpha converting enzyme)

#### MARCM

Leverages FLP-FRT system to accomplish homozygous mutant cell following mitosis

#### Take-aways

We can easily take for granted that layers "exist" a priori, but really it's the interaction between neurons that eventually lead to the establishment of these layers.
