"The drosophila of vertebrates"

## Misc

Genetic / etc profiling can't replace tissue interaction studies.

## Why zebrafish?

### Model Organism Comparison

Do we know what happens in orthologous genes e.g. from invertebrates to vertebrates?

Orthologs/paralogs across species

Paralogs arise via duplications followed by drift
    - Loss of enhancers allows different functions to arise

Focus from adults to embryos after 1950's
    - hydroxide added to drosophila embryos opens genetic screens in embryos

wnt (wingless and int) orthologous to cancer-associated gene in human

Breeding chickens is hard.

Forward genetics limited in mouse due to cost limitations.
    - Genetics is about numbers.

Zebrafish address these issues.

### Zebrafish

External fertilization. Development within few hours.

## Mutagenesis Screens

Mutagen: UV, EMS, **EMU**

### How to check efficiency of mutagenesis? Site-specific complementation test.

m/+ x alb/alb (cross mutagenized to albino)
mutation in albino gene -> m/alb -> Albino (mutant can't dominate alibno)
1000 progeny -> 2 or 3 albino fish. 1 in 400-700

### Screen

#### Most common

Cross wt female with mutagenized male.
F1's are het in mutaitons.
Outcross to wt to get F2 siblings that are het or homozygous reference.
Cross siblings to get F3s that are 25% homozygous.

#### Other methods

* Haploid fish.
* Force diploid in single parent.

#### Adult vs larvae

## Phenotyping

Specificity considerations. How to avoid too many or too rare mutations?

Cell culture limits what questions you can ask. How to replicate niche in a dish?

High-throughput chemical screening - caveats with concentration, etc. DMSO carrier for chemicals dissolves fish.

Adult vs larvae - don't see many phenotypes until adult.

Adult forward screens can inform finding mutations for similar human mutations (macro-"limb" overgrowth).

## How to identify genes from mutants

Mapping mutations using linkage / recombination frequency. Leverage markers in the genome (e.g. microsatellites, known SNPs).

Always selecting for mutation of interest.  Allows mappign of mutation.

centimorgan - 1 recombination / 100 meioses

### WGS

Look at herozygous SNPs vs homozygous SNPs - identify low points.

Use actual seuencing reads to identify mutations - no longer necessary to individually test each gene.

Optimization: Use exome sequencing using arrays.

What about non-coding regions?  Mutations in enhancers not as likely to change behavior.  Makes it difficult to identify.

### Note on causation

#### Rescue

if recessive
* reintroduce wild-type version of gene
* overexpression - BAC, etc.; but sometimes get gain of function mutations that hide rescue

if dominant
* reversion mutation
* Sufficiency

### Genetic series

allele series - complementation

### Mimic phenotype

* down-regulation using morpholinos: antisense oligonucleotides

See: "Nature 2014 Large Scale Discovery Paper..." handed out

However, *Developmental Cell 2015* paper shows that targeted knockouts using nucleases doesn't always replicate morphilo effect. Morpholinos have off-target effects.

#### How morpholinos work

* Block translation through anti-sense binding at translation start site
* block splice site

## Microinjections

Inject any DNA into egg

### Mosaics

Inject transposon / driving TOL2

### Transplantation

## medaka (different fish)

Why vs zebrafish?

Dupication and divergence - different genes relevant to humans

Divergence btw zebrafish and Madaka = 250 million years
    - human vs bird = 150-170 million years

e.g. sirt1 knockout (aging model) deleterious in zebrafish but no phenotype in medaka - implies something in Medaka that supplants sirt1.

## Journal Club - Kawahara, Kunkel PNAS 2011 - DMD in Fish

Use zebrafish as testtube to identify molecule candidates that might improve DMD phenotype.

Follow up studies in Kunkel lab.

## Misc talk after lunch

Chicken into dinsoaur Ted Talk

## Lab session

Went through exercise of identifying zebrafish mutants as well as postulating potential explanatory mechanisms.  The theme of mechanisms was usually inhibition or over-expression of some sort of cell.  Examples include:

* overgrowth of extracellular matrix - "salad fingers"
* shortening of all bones throughout fish - "Midgefish"
* combinations of mutations, i.e. mutation found on background of mutant - "squiggly albino" / "Morlock"
