# DRB Bootcamp: Microscopy

*1/7/15*

## Main Takeaways

If I want to do anything, contact Jennifer Waters or Talley Lambert in Nikon Imaging Core, run by the departments of Cell Biology, Systems Biology, and BCMP.

## Overview

We covered fluorescence and confocal microscopy, as well as some more specific topics.

We were then given tutorials in how to use various instruments.

## Filters

Can use an online tool, e.g. Life Technologies Fluorescence SpectraViewer, to determine the spectrum of your fluorophores as well as your filter blocks for the device.  Sometimes you start with what filter blocks you have available and then design your experiment.  Other times you start with what you want to express and then secure a filter for it.

## Miscellaneous
