## Lecture

Mutation: ~ < 1%
Polymorphism: ~ > 1%

SNP
VNTR - variable number tandem repeats
CNV
Indel

Recombinants / linkage

LOD score: 3.0 significant

### Phasing

Which alleles are on same chromosome

#### Direct phasing

short: use PCR

medium (10s of kb): PCR methods in dev

< 300kb: Make BAC, DNA sequencing

can physically separate chromosomes, e.g. look at many sperm and count typical association rates

otherwise screwed

#### Indirect phasing

Study offspring - should be fewer recombinant than non-recombinant offspring

Example of allele repeat counts

Can we quantify?
Heisengberg uncertainty like phase imposition?

### Case Study: Kidney issues, consanguinity

Ask kidney doctor about known disease / genes

Old days: Candidate genes / linkage studies

Say you're told it's Bartter syndrome

Go to OMIM, Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man, identify several genes

Now we can do next-generation sequencing, either whole exome or whole genome

Identify gene of interest.  Follow up with Sanger.  Look at protein domain location.

In this case, turns out CLD, not Bartter syndrome

### Case Study: Familial Combined Hypolipidemia

First did manual haplotype phasing. Identify single linkage peak.

Then looked at SNVs from whole exome sequencing data. Found compound heterozygous, internal stop codons introduced. Happen to fall under linkage peak.

### Genome Editing

Cultured cells (HeLa, etc.)

Previously, need cultured cells of right tissue type (e.g. for studying myocardial infarction, might want something like blood vessels)

How to address Koch's postulates?

Want cells from specific patient.  Revert to PSC state, then introduce or remove mutations of interest.

Manimals.

Discussion of classic knock-outs and knock-ins.

It might become standard for publications / grad students to run experiments in multiple model organism systems, since editing is easier now.

Humanized mice.

## Journal Club

**Liu GH, Qu J, Suzuki K, et al. Progressive degeneration of human neural stem cells caused by pathogenic LRRK2. Nature. 2012 Nov 22;491(7425):603-7.**

Shows both necessity and sufficiency of single mutation implicated in inherited predisposition to Parkinson's disease.  Mutation in question causes nuclear envelope morphology disruption.
