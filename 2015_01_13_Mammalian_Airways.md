## Lecture

Nobel prize: Fibroblasts + 4 transcription factors to reprogram cells
* frog portion showed that genome is intact

How do tissues maintain cell type balance?

Most of remaining lecture talks about Tata 2013 Nature paper discussed in journal club below.

### Implications

* Tissue architecture
* Regeneration
* Infection - enormous selective pressure, e.g. in aquatic to land transition when we started breathing air.
* Cancer

#### Cancer

EGFR mutations. Chemotherapy applies pressures that turns cancer from non-small-cell cancer to small-cell cancer. Cell changes fate in order to avoid problems.

**Vague vocaulary.** See review on stem cell terminology (Dan will send?)

## Journal Club

**Tata PR, Mou H, Pardo-Saganta A, Zhao R, Prabhu M, Law BM, Vinarsky V, Cho JL, Breton S, Sahay A, Medoff BD, Rajagopal J. Dedifferentiation of committed luminal epithelial cells into functional stem cells in vivo. Nature, 2013; 503: 218-223**

### My summary

The paper demonstrates that secretory cells can dedifferentiate into basal stem cells upon ablation of basal cells. The mechanism that regulates this is cell contact with basal cells. This was demonstrated by performing sphere assay.  Starting with secretory cells alone results in the generation of basal stem cells.  The presence of even a few basal stem cells in contact results in no dedifferentiation.

As I understand, the impact of this paper is that cells do dedifferentiate back to stem cell form in vivo.  I wonder if it's possible to further dedifferentiate them through these methods.

It might be relevant to read the Nobel prize iPSC stem cell papers.

### Rajagopal lecture

Airways: basal cells are stem cells (meaning they can replicate themselves)

Atempting to make cystic fibrosis model

Use Ki67 to visualize dividing cells.  Expected Ki67 in basal stem cells.  Instead, observed Ki67 in secretory cells.

Move onto lineage tracing. Use stopped-reporter + recombination.

Need to be careful: Alternative explanation would be that remaining basal cells would turn on secretory cell markers.

Went ex vivo.  Not as trusted because cells are highly plastic ex vivo. Sphere-forming assay.

Clonality - did it all come from single cell?

Results show that most results are all secretory or all basal cells.  Mixed sphere is rare. Implies that even a single basal cell suppresses dedifferentiation of secretory cells.

What about if ciliated cells are ablated?  Surprising: System shows no response. So how do you make ciliated cells? Tissue doesn't appear to be measuring number of ciliated cells.

Apoptosis generally poorly understood.  Difficult to assay because dead cells are cleaned up so quickly.

Following basal cell ablation, secretory cells don't just dedifferentiate into basal stem cells, but also differentiate into cilliated cells.

Focused on notch.

Niches of stem cells. Stem cells as "niches" for progenitors.

Limitations of feedback system: Can't change fast. Feed forward system allows you to anticipate change and engage ahead of time. Still need regulation internally. So feed forward systems are fast but they can run away. Requries feedback system for regulation.
