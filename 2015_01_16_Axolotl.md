# DRB Bootcamp: Axolotl, Limb Regeneration

## Lecture

homeostasis vs uncontrolled regeneration (tumor) vs correct regeneration/3D pattern, etc.

Limitations: Genome not sequenced. 10x size of human genome.

Children can regenerate finger tips as long as wound is not sutured.

Many papers about expression, not function due to limited ability to study function.  Now can study function.

Engineered viruses to infect axolotls.

CRISPR is more efficient than TALENS.  Successfully disrupts SOX2.  Development proceeds mostly okay.  Regeneration doesn't work.  Development probably rescued by SOX3, but regeneration still not rescued.
